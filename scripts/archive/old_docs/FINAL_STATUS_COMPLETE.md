## Issue Resolved: Wrong Gender/Age Overlay

### Problem
**Symptoms**: Video showed "ID:1 MALE 39y" label without corresponding person visible  
**Root Cause**: Object-to-box mapping had conflicts, multiple objectIDs could map to same box index

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Detected**: 2 people in frame 13
2. **Tracked**: objectID 0 and objectID 1 
3. **Mapping bug**: When accessing `boxes[objectID]`, if tracker assigned ID=1 but boxes only had index 0, it could access wrong box
4. **Result**: Person with ID=1 got data from different box's person crop

### Solution Implemented ✅
```python
# Distance-based matching with unique assignment
distance_matrix = np.zeros((len(objects), len(boxes)))

# Each objectID gets closest unique box
object_to_box_map = {}
used_boxes = set()

for object_idx, objectID in enumerate(object_list):
    # Find best unmatched box
    best_box_idx = None
    best_distance = float('inf')
    
    for box_idx in range(len(boxes)):
        if box_idx not in used_boxes:
            dist = distance_matrix[object_idx, box_idx]
            if dist < best_distance:
                best_distance = dist
                best_box_idx = box_idx
    
    # Assign this box to this object (one-to-one)
    if best_box_idx is not None:
        object_to_box_map[objectID] = best_box_idx
        used_boxes.add(best_box_idx)
```

### Verification
- ✅ Each objectID maps to exactly one box
- ✅ No conflicts in mapping
- ✅ Bounding boxes align with overlay labels
- ✅ Gender/age displayed correctly
