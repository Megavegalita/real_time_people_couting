# Progress Log - Quality Enhancement

**Date**: 2024-10-27  
**Video**: shopping_korea.mp4  
**Goal**: Working gender & age analysis

## ‚úÖ Completed

### Phase 1: DNN Face Detector
- ‚úÖ Created DNNFaceDetector class
- ‚úÖ Improved Haar Cascade fallback
- ‚úÖ Dynamic face size detection (15-80px)
- ‚úÖ Face detection working: 181 faces in 100 frames

### Test Results
```
‚úÖ Face detection: 181 faces detected
‚úÖ Average: 1.81 faces/frame  
‚úÖ Success: Significant improvement
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues

### Issue: Gender/Age Analysis Failing
- **Problem**: analyze_person getting "No face detected" in person crops
- **Root cause**: Faces detected in full frame but not in person crops
- **Why**: Person crops may not contain full face, or face detection on crop fails

### Statistics
```
Frames: 50 tested
Detections: 126 people detected
Analysis attempts: 126
Success: 0
Failures: 126
Reason: "No face detected" in person crops
```

## üîß Next Steps

### Issue Analysis
The problem is that:
1. Face detection works on full frames (181 faces detected)
2. But analyze_person tries to detect faces in person crops
3. Person crops may not contain good face regions
4. Need to improve face detection in small crops

### Solutions to Try

#### Solution 1: Better Crop Preprocessing
- Upscale person crops before face detection
- Enhance contrast and sharpness
- Use adaptive thresholding

#### Solution 2: Direct Frame Analysis
- Detect faces in full frame
- Then match to person bounding boxes
- Use face crop for gender/age analysis

#### Solution 3: Multi-Scale Face Detection
- Try multiple scales in person crop
- Use smaller minimum face size
- Test various preprocessing

## üìä Current Code Status

### Working ‚úÖ
- Face detection in full frames: ‚úÖ
- Improved Haar Cascade: ‚úÖ
- DNN integration: ‚úÖ
- Person tracking: ‚úÖ

### Not Working ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Face detection in person crops: ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Gender/age analysis: ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement upscaling for person crops
2. Add preprocessing (contrast, sharpness)
3. Test on person crops
4. Measure improvement

**Status**: Face detection working, need to fix crop analysis
