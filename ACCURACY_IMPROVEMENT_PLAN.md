# Accuracy Improvement Plan

## Current Status Analysis

### What We Have
- Face detection rate: **10%** (too low)
- Body detection: **Excellent** (205+ bodies)
- Gender estimation: **Body-based heuristics** (not ML)
- Analysis efficiency: **Good** (one-time per person)
- FPS: **46.8** (excellent)

### Root Problems

1. **Face Detection (10%)** ❌
   - Faces too small: 44x82 pixels
   - Below minimum for DeepFace (64x64)
   - Many people not getting gender/age analysis

2. **Gender Accuracy** ⚠️
   - Currently using heuristics (body-based)
   - Not real ML model
   - Accuracy may be 60-70% (needs validation)

3. **Face Quality** ❌
   - Video has distant people (10-15m)
   - Low resolution for faces
   - Not suitable for accurate face analysis

---

## Improvement Strategies

### Strategy 1: Face Super-Resolution ⭐ (Medium Priority)

**Goal**: Upscale faces to make them usable for DeepFace

**Technologies**:
1. **Real-ESRGAN** (Best for faces)
   - Can upscale 2x-4x
   - Pre-trained models
   - Better quality than basic interpolation

2. **ESPCN (OpenCV)**
   - Fast upscaling
   - Integrated in OpenCV
   - Good for real-time

**Implementation**:
```python
def super_resolve_face(face_crop):
    """Upscale face from 44x82 to 132x246 (3x)."""
    from realesrgan import RealESRGAN
    model = RealESRGAN("x3")
    upscaled = model.enhance(face_crop)
    return upscaled
```

**Expected**:
- Face detection: 10% → 50-70%
- DeepFace success: 0% → 60-80%
- Time: +50-100ms per face

**Pros**: Real ML gender detection
**Cons**: Slower, complex setup

---

### Strategy 2: Better Body Analysis ⭐⭐⭐ (High Priority)

**Goal**: Improve body-based gender estimation accuracy

**Current**: Simple heuristics (height, aspect ratio)
**Improvement**: Add more sophisticated features

#### Option A: Machine Learning on Body Features

```python
def extract_body_features(person_crop):
    """Extract features from body."""
    features = {
        'height': crop.shape[0],
        'width': crop.shape[1],
        'area': crop.shape[0] * crop.shape[1],
        'aspect_ratio': crop.shape[0] / crop.shape[1],
        'color_histogram': calculate_hist(crop),
        'body_shape': analyze_shape(crop),
        'clothing_pattern': detect_patterns(crop)
    }
    return features

def predict_gender(features):
    """Use ML model to predict."""
    # Train or use pre-trained model
    gender = model.predict(features)
    return gender
```

**Accuracy**: 70-85%
**Pros**: Real ML, better than heuristics
**Cons**: Requires training data

#### Option B: Deep Learning Body Features

Train a lightweight CNN on body crops:
```python
# Architecture
Conv2D(32) -> Conv2D(64) -> Dense(128) -> Dense(2)

# Training
- Dataset: Body images with gender labels
- Classes: Male, Female
- Accuracy target: 80%+
```

**Accuracy**: 80-90%
**Pros**: State-of-the-art
**Cons**: Requires training, data

---

### Strategy 3: Ensemble Methods ⭐⭐ (Medium Priority)

**Goal**: Combine multiple estimation methods

```python
def ensemble_gender_estimation(person_crop, face_crop=None):
    """Combine multiple methods."""
    
    results = []
    
    # Method 1: Body-based heuristics
    body_result = analyze_from_body(person_crop)
    results.append(body_result)
    
    # Method 2: Face-based (if available)
    if face_crop and face_crop.size > 64*64:
        face_result = DeepFace.analyze(face_crop)
        results.append(face_result)
    
    # Method 3: Clothing/appearance
    appearance_result = analyze_appearance(person_crop)
    results.append(appearance_result)
    
    # Weighted voting
    final_gender = weighted_vote(results)
    return final_gender
```

**Accuracy**: 75-90% (depending on methods)
**Pros**: Robust, combines strengths
**Cons**: More complex

### Strategy 4: Accept Limitations, Focus on What Works ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Recommended)

**Reality**: Video quality limits face detection
**Solution**: Maximize body detection benefits

**Improvements**:
1. ✅ Better body detection (already good)
2. ✅ Optimize 11-vote system (already implemented)
3. ✅ Add confidence scoring
4. ✅ Track confidence per person
5. ✅ Visual feedback on confidence

1. Add confidence scoring to 11-vote system
2. Improve body feature extraction
3. Add more voting criteria
4. Track and display confidence

**Expected**: 75-80% accuracy

### Phase 2: Face Enhancement (4-6 hours) (If needed)
1. Implement face super-resolution
2. Re-enable DeepFace for larger faces
3. Hybrid approach: body + face when possible

**Expected**: 80-90% accuracy

### Phase 3: ML Integration (8-12 hours) (Future)

- Body proportions (detailed)
- Movement patterns (over time)
- Multiple body features extraction
```

**Task 2: Confidence Scoring**
```python
def calculate_confidence(votes):

    male_votes = votes.count("MALE")
    female_votes = votes.count("FEMALE")
    total = len(votes)
    
    confidence = max(male_votes, female_votes) / total
    return confidence
```

**Task 3: Better Feature Extraction**
```python
def extract_body_features(person_crop):
    """Extract comprehensive body features."""
    h, w = person_crop.shape[:2]
    
    features = {
        'height': h,
        'width': w,
        'area': h * w,
        'aspect_ratio': h / w,
        
        # Color analysis
        'dominant_colors': extract_dominant_colors(person_crop),
        'color_variance': calculate_color_variance(person_crop),
        
        # Body shape analysis
        'upper_body_ratio': analyze_upper_body(person_crop),
        'leg_ratio': analyze_legs(person_crop),
        
        # Texture/pattern
        'texture_features': extract_texture(person_crop),
    }
    
    return features
