## ⚠️ Issues Found

### Gender/Age Analysis Failed
- **Analyses done**: 0
- **Analyses failed**: 10
- **Reason**: Face detection within person crops likely failing

### Analysis:
1. Video has people in shopping center
2. People are likely far/obscured
3. Face detection needs adjustment for small/distant faces

---

## 🔧 Recommendations

### 1. Adjust Face Detection Parameters
```python
# Increase min face size for better detection
min_face_size = 50  # Current
# Try 30-40 for better detection
```

### 2. Implement Fallback
- If face detection fails, use person-level features
- Alternative: Use deep learning for whole-body gender estimation

### 3. Test with Better Video
- Try video with closer/clearer faces
- Or add test videos with visible faces
