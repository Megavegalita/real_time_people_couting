## 🔧 Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Face Detection in Person Crops
**Problem**: Face detection failing within person bounding boxes

**Root Causes**:
1. People in video are distant/small
2. Face detection using Haar Cascade may be too strict
3. Person crops may not contain clear faces

**Solutions**:
- Adjust face detection parameters
- Use DNN-based face detection
- Implement whole-body gender estimation as fallback

### Issue 2: Models Not Trained
**Problem**: Gender/age models not trained yet

**Solution**: 
- Models are placeholders (structure ready)
- Need training data
- Current tests validate structure works
