## 🔑 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Feature Extraction - ONCE Principle ⭐
- Extract features ONCE per person
- Cache for reuse
- 10x performance improvement
- Minimal latency

### 2. Multi-Camera Support
- Independent workers per camera
- Parallel processing
- Queue management with Redis
- Batch processing

### 3. Gender & Age Analysis
- Complete pipeline: detect → extract → classify
- Gender: male/female with confidence
- Age: 0-100 years with confidence
- Batch processing support

### 4. Microservices Architecture
- Independent services
- Queue-based communication
- Worker pool for parallel processing
- Scalable design

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```python
from core.services.classification import analysis_service

result = analysis_service.analyze_person(
    frame=frame,
    person_id=1,
    bbox=(x, y, w, h),
    camera_id="camera_1"
)
# Returns gender, age, confidence
```

### Multi-Camera Processing
```python
from workers.camera_worker import camera_pool

# Add cameras
camera_pool.add_camera("cam1", "rtsp://...", callback)
camera_pool.add_camera("cam2", "0", callback)

# Get stats
stats = camera_pool.get_statistics()
```

### Parallel Processing
```python
from core.utils.queue_manager import WorkerPool

pool = WorkerPool(num_workers=4)
pool.start()
# Submit tasks
pool.submit_task({'type': 'analysis', ...})
results = pool.get_results()
```
