## 🔑 Key Services

### FaceDetector (core/services/face_processing.py)
```python
from core.services.face_processing import FaceDetector

detector = FaceDetector(min_face_size=50, confidence_threshold=0.5)
detections = detector.detect_faces(image)
# Returns: List of detections with bounding boxes
```

### FaceFeatureExtractor (core/services/feature_extraction.py)
```python
from core.services.feature_extraction import FaceFeatureExtractor

extractor = FaceFeatureExtractor()
features = extractor.extract_features(face_crop)
# Returns: 128-dim numpy array
```

### CachedFeatureExtractor (KEY OPTIMIZATION)
```python
from core.services.feature_extraction import CachedFeatureExtractor

cached = CachedFeatureExtractor()
features = cached.get_or_extract_features(person_id, frame, bbox)
# First call: Extract + Cache
# Subsequent calls: Return from cache (< 1ms)
```
