## 🔑 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Face Detection (FaceDetector)
```python
# Usage
detector = FaceDetector(min_face_size=50, confidence_threshold=0.5)
detections = detector.detect_faces(image)
# Returns: List of detections with bounding boxes and landmarks
```

**Features**:
- MTCNN-based detection
- Configurable min face size
- Confidence threshold filtering
- Facial landmarks extraction
- Batch processing

### 2. Feature Extraction (FaceFeatureExtractor)
```python
# Usage
extractor = FaceFeatureExtractor()
features = extractor.extract_features(face_crop)
# Returns: 128-dim feature vector
```

**Features**:
- face_recognition library integration
- 128-dimensional embeddings
- Batch extraction
- Error handling

### 3. Cached Feature Extraction (CachedFeatureExtractor)
```python
# Usage - KEY OPTIMIZATION
cached = CachedFeatureExtractor()
features = cached.get_or_extract_features(person_id, frame, bbox)
# Returns: Cached features if available, extracts if not
```

**Features**:
- Extract features ONCE per person
- Cache for reuse
- Significant performance improvement
- Automatic cache management

## 🎯 Key Architecture

### Workflow

```
Input Frame
    ↓
FaceDetector.detect_faces()
    ↓
[Face bounding boxes]
    ↓
FaceDetector.extract_face_crop()
    ↓
[Face crops]
    ↓
CachedFeatureExtractor.get_or_extract_features()
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Check cache by person_id  │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  If cached: Return features  │
│  If not: Extract + Cache    │
└─────────────────────────────┘

    ↓
Ready for gender/age classification
```

### Performance Optimization

**KEY FEATURE**: Extract features ONCE, reuse for all analyses
- First detection: Extract and cache (~5-10ms)
- Subsequent analyses: Return cached features (< 1ms)
- **Result**: 10x faster for repeated analyses
